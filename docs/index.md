% Hello! Why are you here?


## You want to get better at brain surgery

Let me say that another way.

- You want to show that you really  understand AI 
- You want to demonstrate that  your experience lets you
refactor and simplify AI algorithms.
  - Commission AI systems easier,  faster, get them to run faster,
  apply them to more problems,  make them  more maintainable.

Also, maybe you want to teach others about how to be an AI brain surgeons.

- In Spring'24 I tried this out on some AI newbs (NC grad students)
  - The results were amazing
- Dozens of publication-worthy papers looking into previously unexplored issues.
  - So cool.
- But can we do it again?

## What will we study?

1. Current hot topics in [automated SE](https://link.springer.com/journal/10515/articles).
2. Ways to improve AI engineering with something called "active learning" (to be defined, later)

A standard project in this subject would test itself on data from dozens of SE projects.

- [MOOT (multi-objective optimization testing)](https://github.com/timm/moot/tree/master/optimize)
    is a repository with
  - some 60 SE problems 
    - and a few others  like wine tasting and car design
  - decision making in SE projects
    - reduce costs
    - reduce number of Defects
    - increase the number of successfully previously implemented features
  - configuration in SE systems
    - find the software configuration settings that most reduce (e.g. runtimes, query times, usage, etc).
  - hyper-parameter optimization
    - find better settings for random forest classifiers (aside: our methods could
         apply to the tuning of any learners).

## Why do this class?

- It is amazing :
  - 20-40 samples of any domain and we can model it? Incroyable!  Je suis stupéfait ! Cela change tout !
- It is good engineering:
    - If we know it well, we can build it better. Period.
- You want to be a better coder:
  - I promise, by the time I am done with you, you will be a  Python wizard.
- You want to be a captain, not a passenger.
  - Everyone else can code and drive LLMs
  - But who is learning how to efficiently  learn control policies?
- It is necessary:
  - The world has gone mad on complexity, on algorithms that are so expensive that only a few large organizations can run the fashionable algorithms.
    - Is that wise? Is there an alternative?
- It is easy. 
  - AI is amazingly easy, if you look at it the right way.

  - "Less, but better"<br>-- Dieter Rams
  - "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when 
     there is nothing left to take away."<br>-- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry:
- It is good science. 
  - Here we learn how to
    - change our minds.
    - peek a  little at the world, reflect on what was learned, then decide what to do next.
    - make good decisions, even before all the facts are it.
  - Is this just about the engineering of smart software? 
  - Or is it about
    -  science in general?
    -  a philosophy for how to live in the real world?
