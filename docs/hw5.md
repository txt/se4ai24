1. **Problem of Comparing Samples**
   What are the two main parts of the problem when comparing samples,
   and how do significance tests and effect size tests help address
   these parts?

2. **Statistical Significance vs. Effect Size**
   How can two samples be statistically significant but have only
   a small effect size? Why is this distinction important in practice?

3. **Real-World SE Example: Distributed Development**
   Compare the findings of Bird et al. (2009) and Kocaguneli et al.  (2013) regarding the impact of distributed development on software quality. What did each study conclude?

4. **Curve Overlap and Standard Deviation**
   What happens to the interpretability of sample differences when
   the standard deviations of the distributions increase, causing
   overlap?

5. **Assumptions in Parametric Statistical Tests**
   Why are parametric statistical tests used in some scenarios, and
   what assumptions about the data distribution are required for
   these tests to be valid?

6. **Challenges of Parametric Tests**
   What are some limitations of using parametric statistical tests,
   especially when dealing with real-world data that might not fit
   a simple distribution?

7. **Scott-Knott Method for Grouping Means**
   How does the Scott-Knott method work to cluster means in a set
   of samples, and what is the connect beteen Scott-Knott and
   (e.g.) effect size tests.

8. **Cohen’s Delta and Small Effect Size**
   What role does Cohen’s delta play in determining whether one
   distribution is considered similar to another? What threshold
   value is used in the lecture, and what does it represent?

9. **Differences Between Parametric and Non-Parametric Tests**
   How do non-parametric tests like CliffsDelta and bootstrap differ
   from parametric tests, and why might they be preferred in some
   cases?

10. **Blurring in Results Interpretation**
    What is "blurring" when interpreting the results of statistical
    comparisons, and why is it significant when analyzing treatments
    with large variance?

11. **Runtime and Storage Considerations in Statistics**
    Why are non-parametric tests generally slower and more
    memory-intensive than parametric tests? When might it be
    appropriate to use quick approximations instead?
