<h1 class="title">Lit Review</h1>
</header>
<p>The “lit review” is really the first 3-4 pages of a research paper.
I’ll be reading it to see if you have insights into the material from
class and/or a vision of the future.</p>
<p>Note that better papers (that score higher marks) will find from the
literature some baseline statements and/or algorithms and/or tools that
they can extend. This means that you will be assessing prior work not
just on its words but also on the algorithms/tools/ data they provide.
Warning: many so-called reproduction packages from research papers are
not very good (will not compile, cannot get to the data, takes too long
to run, etc). So there will be much backwards and forwards and you find
something praising, find you cannot use it, then go hunt for something
else.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-hand-in">What to Hand in</h2>
<p>A pdf written in the <a href="Access_LaTeX_template.zip">IEEE Access
latex style</a> (rename the file access.tex to main.tex). Upload all
this into an Overleaf project. Do you work. Generate the pdf. Submit
that to Moodle. For help notes, see the file <a
href="access.pdf">access.pdf</a> or the excellent on-line help files of
Overleaf..</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>Please use the following structure (or lose marks).</p>
<p>Please take the following lengths as approximate. Feel free to
add/subtract half a page for each.</p>
<h2 id="page1">Page1</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>COOL TILE</strong>: have fun with this. take your abstract,
give it to chatgpt and ask it for a provocative and eye-catching, yet
professional title for a software engineering research paper.</li>
<li><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> (300 words max)</li>
<li>An eight para <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
<ul>
<li>Para1: everyone does something</li>
<li>Para2: there is something wrong with that</li>
<li>Para3: you have an insight into how that might be fixed</li>
<li>Para4: so this is what you did</li>
<li>Para5: caveats. No paper solves all problems. What are the limits of
this analysis.</li>
<li>Para6: “To help structure this investigation, Figure 1 shows the
workflow we will use to explore the data of Table 1 to answer the
following research questions” (followed by two or more RQs)
<ul>
<li>This will give me some insight into your research approach.</li>
<li>Use the hw1 extension to populate Table~1. Or use complete different
data. But tell me you have some case study data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Para7: “Overall, the contribution of this paper is…” (followed by a
list of two to three main things; just make something up here)</li>
<li>Para8: “The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
<ul>
<li>Para8 ends with. “This is followed by our conclusion:
<code>\begin{quote}{\em elevator pitch}\end{quote}</code> where”elevator
pitch” is 2-3 lines that summarize the take away of the paper. For
example:
<ul>
<li><em>To fix bias, it might suffice to apply mutators to the training
data in order to (A) remove biased labels; and (B) rebalance internal
distributions such that they are equal based on class and sensitive
attributes. </em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="page2">Page2</h2>
<ul>
<li>A top-of-page figure describing the problem and your solution</li>
<li>Table 1</li>
<li><strong>LIT REVIEW</strong>
<ul>
<li>1 - 2 pages that respects and disrespects the past.</li>
<li>It respectfully details what was done.</li>
<li>It disrespects prior results, just enough to say why you are not
just using all the old methods.,</li>
<li>Lit review should include a table of categorized main cited papers
and a venn diagram showing the overlap of what other people have done
<ul>
<li>e.g. see section 2.4 and table4 of
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03697.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lit review should end with something like:a
<ul>
<li>In summary, prior work suffered from
<ul>
<li>Some issue1</li>
<li>Some issue2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hence, for the rest of this paper, we explore a solution that finds
these issues by XXX, which will result in YYY</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="and-the-rest">And the Rest</h2>

worry about getting it 100% right. Just show me what you understand, so

<h2 id="hints-and-tips">Hints and Tips</h2>
<p>Writing a lit review is not a linear process. At any stage, your
understanding of things may breakthrough into another layer of superior
comprehension. This means you have to back and start again. Hey, its
called “research” since you search again and again and again and…</p>
<p>Ideally, all your papers are recent, highly cited, and from
top-ranked venues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pragmatically, you do what you can. But if you include something
with four citataions from the Eastern Tasmanian workshop on small blue
things, I will be asking you “why, oh why”</li>
<li>For a list of top ranked venues, see (e.g. <a
href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=eng_softwaresystems">Google
Scholar Metrics</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps for a lit review:</p>
<ul>
<li>REFLECT: find terms of interesting. 3-5 terms.
<ul>
<li>For a list of candidate problems <a
href="what2do.html">what2do.html</a>. But feel free to go beyond this
list.</li>
<li>Note you will initially get this wrong. e.g. I was looking for
“software engineering” “active leaning” initialization and got very
little back. Then after some reading, I realized that “warm start” was
the more standard term for “initialization”. Which got me to some very
cool stuff indeed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SEARCH: search google scholar , find the 100 most recent (eg. since
2020<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) most cited paperas</li>
<li>SORT the 100, find “knee” where the counts even out. Usually these
selects 20 to 60 papers</li>
<li>SKIM those above knee, discarding the irrelevant ones (now you
should be down to 10 to 30)</li>
<li>SNOWBALL: using your own domain knowledge, add in important papers;
e.g. papers that everyone cites from 20 years ago, or a paper that
really interests you, etc. So 20 papers might contain,say, five
snowballs.</li>
<li>DISCUSS: if you find a cool paper, talk about it with other people
in the class (feel free to use the #papers channel of Discourse). Maybe
others can point you to some really cool stuff.</li>
<li>READ the 12 to 36 paper selected by SKIMing and SNOWBALLings
DISCUSSing. See how they fit into you terms</li>
<li>DRAW a venn diagram showing how papers overlap on your terms</li>
<li>FIND THE GAPS (regions of the venn with low counts)</li>
<li>WRITE the lit review.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an example of this, see section 2.4 and table4 of
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03697.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>How far back should you go? For LLM stuff, you
definitely want to latest. For other ideas, you might consider past ten
years (but see “snowballing”– which might take you to some classic, much
older, papers).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
