<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Current hot topics in automated SE. Ways to improve AI engineering
with called active learning. Optimization. Classification/Regression.
Clustering. Analytics. Experimental methods. Reseaerch methods in
advanced SE and statistics. A standard project in this subject would
test itself on data from dozens of SE projects.</p>
<h3 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>To enable students to develop as successful professionals for highly
competitive positions, applying “AI to SE” and “SE to AI” in academic
departments, industry, and government.</li>
<li>To prepare students to be effective researchers in the field of “AI
for SE” and “SE for AI”</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
<ul>
<li>Students will achieve a high level of expertise in “AI to SE” and
“SE to AI” , mastery of the knowledge in that fields and the ability to
apply this knowledge and graduate school experiences to critical
research problems</li>
<li>Students will become independent researchers in “AI to SE” and “SE
to AI”, developing a substantial expertise in that area that allows them
to make an original contribution to it</li>
<li>Students will state a research problem in such a way that it clearly
fits within the context of the literature in “AI to SE” and “SE to AI”
and demonstrate the value of the solution to the research problem in
advancing knowledge within that area</li>

large project, due end Sept, Oct, November.</p>
<p>Exams are done individually. Everything else is done in groups of 3
(groups of 1 for 700 level students)</p>
<ul>
<li>Homeworks are small tasks
<ul>
<li>Submitted each week (a URL, to Mooddle);</li>
<li>Graded -1 (for no submission; permanent mark), -1 (for “please try
again” reversed in you resubmit in a week) and 0 for “good”;</li>
<li>May be remarked and resubmitted the week after first
submission.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grades">Grades</h3>
<p>Every grade can be remared, except <em>report2</em> and the <em>final

<p>Otherwise, students are marked -1 for “not on time” or “try again”.
If you get a “-1” mark and resubmit, they are replaced with a “0”.</p>
<p>For the rport, students will lose 2 marks per day for late
submissions (weekend = 2 day).</p>
<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>
<h3 id="preferred-method-of-communication-response-time">Preferred
Method of Communication &amp; Response Time</h3>
<p>It is each student’s responsibility to join the class Discord group
“se4aiFall24”. Till Friday week1, the link to join there is <a
href="https://discord.gg/rKrDJPHK">here</a> (this invite link will
expire in a few days)</p>
<p>Nearly all the class communication from staff to students will be via
this Discord group.</p>
<p>You should expect to receive a response within two business days
(i.e. not over the weekend). - If I email/message you directly, please
strive to respond within two business days. - It is recommended that you
check your NC State email at least once a day to stay on top of course
communications.</p>
<p>If you have a question about the course or its content, you can email
me or post your question on our discord group. You can expect to receive
a response within two business days (i.e. not over the weekend)</p>
<p>If you need to contact me directly, my preferred method of
communication is the discord group. However, for private matters, feel
free to contact me via email.<br />
If emailing then: - Always include a descriptive, specific but concise
subject. - Include your course number your email, and provide adequate
context for your question in order to ensure full understanding of your
email. - Be sure to use your NC State email account, and sign in with
your name and Student ID number.</p>
<h3
id="expectations-for-learner-participation-and-interaction">Expectations
for learner participation and interaction</h3>
<p>Course activities will require you to interact with other students in
the course. For masters students, some evidence must be generated that
you are actively engaged with your class peers. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project repo MUST have a branch called “MAIN”. Groups will be
assessed via their commit history (seen under “Insights”) in MAIN.
Projects were all group members are not active doing commits will lose
marks (or the offending student will be expelled from that group).</li>
<li>Groups need to maintain an active discussion in the channel within
the subject’s Discord channel. Projects were all group members are not
active in discussions will either lose marks (or the offending student
will be expelled from that group).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>
<p>Lectures are twice a week. Lectures will be recorded.</p>
<p>Attendance is not mandatory, but highly recommended.</p>
<p>If, for a quiz, you must be absence for a reason sanction by the
university, contact the lecturer before time and other arrangements will
be made. Those sanctioned events are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The student is away from campus representing an official university
function, e.g., participating in a professional meeting, as part of a
judging team, or athletic team. These students would typically be
accompanied by a University faculty or staff member.</li>
<li>Required court attendance as certified by the Clerk of Court.</li>
<li>Students will be allowed a minimum of two excused absences per
academic year for religious observances as verified by the Division of
Academic and Student Affairs (DASA) (go.ncsu.edu/absence). For more
information about a variety of religious observances, visit the
Diversity Calendar.</li>
<li>Required military duty as certified by the student’s commanding
officer.</li>
<li>Unanticipated Absences. Excuses for unanticipated absences must be
reported to the instructor as soon as possible, but not more than one
week after the return to class. Examples of unanticipated absences are:
<ul>
<li>Short-term illness or injury affecting the ability to attend or to
be productive academically while in class, or that could jeopardize the
health of the individual or the health of the classmates attending.
Students must notify instructors prior to the class absence, if
possible, that they are temporarily unable to attend class or complete
assignments on time.</li>
<li>Death or serious illnesses in the family when documented
appropriately. An attempt to verify deaths or serious illness will be
made by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs
(go.ncsu.edu/absence).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to attend mandatory
office hours session. There, students may be asked to review code,
concepts, or comment on the structure of the course. Those sessions are
mandatory and failure to attend will result in marks being deducted.</p>
<h3 id="disabilities">Disabilities</h3>
<p>Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable
disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations,
students must register with the <a
href="https://dro.dasa.ncsu.edu/">Disability Resource Office (DRO)</a>
For more information on NC State’s policy on working with students with
disabilities, please see the <a

<h3 id="respecting-our-learning-community">Respecting our learning
community</h3>
<p>The NC State Code of Student Conduct outlines expectations for
behavior in the classroom (whether virtual or physical) and the
consequences for students who violate these expectations. Any behavior
that impacts other students’ ability to learn and succeed will be
addressed, but expressing diverse viewpoints and interpretations of
course content is welcome. Community guidelines for this course include:
- Use a respectful tone in all forms of communication (email, messages,
written, oral, visual) - Maintain professionalism (avoid slang, poor
grammar, etc.) in your written communication. - Respect regional
dialects and culturally embedded ways of oral communication. - Stay home
or in your dorm room if you are exhibiting symptoms of a contagious
illness (fever, chills, etc.). - Enter our virtual and/or physical
classroom community respectfully by refraining from lewd or indecent
speech or behavior, helping to maintain a safe physical environment, not
using your cell phone for voice or text communication except when
explicitly given leave to do so, and not attending class under the
influence of any substance. - Treat each community member with respect
by not recording others without their consent or engaging in any form of
hazing, harassment, intimidation, or abuse. - Respect cultural
differences that may influence communication styles and needs.]</p>
<p>Any remark you make in some on-line comment tracking system like
Github is a public document. So take heed of the following cautionary
tale. One year, a student was joking around with his buddy in a Github
issue report. Then he was rude enough and stupid enough to add a remark
about how the rest of the team was just so ■■■■ ■■■■■■■■. Needless to
say, the rest of the team took great offense at this remark and invoked
the University’s non-discrimination policies. As a result, everyone lost
much time that semester, as well as grades.</p>
<h3 id="expected-workload">Expected Workload</h3>
<p>This is an <em>advanced graduate</em> class at R1 institution (an R1
institution is classified as a doctoral university with very high
research activity).</p>
<p>Students must be prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a
week to this class (excluding the time spent in the lecture meeting).
Laboratory instruction is not included in this subject.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Students are required to comply with the university policy on
academic integrity found in the i <a
href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01">Code of Student
Conduct 11.35.01 sections 8 and 9</a>. Therefore, students are required
to uphold the Pack Pledge: “I have neither given nor received
unauthorized aid on this test or assignment.” i Violations of academic
integrity will be handled in accordance with the <a
href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-02/">Student
Discipline Procedures</a>.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a
href="https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/academic-integrity-overview/">Academic
Integrity web page</a> for a detailed explanation of the University’s
policies on academic integrity and some of the common understandings
related to those policies.</p>
<p>Cheating will be punished to the full extent permitted. Cheating
includes plagiarism of other people’s work. All students will be working
on public code repositories and <strong>informed reuse</strong> is
encouraged where someone else’s product is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imported and clearly acknowledged (as to where it came from);</li>
<li>The imported project is understood, and</li>
<li>The imported project is significantly extended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are encouraged to read each others code and report
<strong>uninformed reuse</strong> to the lecturer. The issue will be
explored and, if uncovered, cheating will be reported to the university
